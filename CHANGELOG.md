### Migration Guide
- N/A (Initial release)

### Dependencies
- **Core Dependencies**:
  - `fastapi >= 0.104.0` - Web framework
  - `sqlalchemy >= 2.0.0` - ORM
  - `pydantic >= 2.0.0` - Data validation
  - `typer >= 0.9.0` - CLI framework
  - `jinja2 >= 3.1.0` - Template engine
  - `pyyaml >= 6.0` - YAML processing
  - `openapi-spec-validator >= 0.7.0` - OpenAPI validation

- **Optional Dependencies**:
